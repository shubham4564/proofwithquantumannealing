1. SLOT TIMING (Biggest Impact on TPS)
   - Current: 10-second slots = Max 1 block per 10s
   - Solution: Reduce slot_duration_seconds

2. LEADER ROTATION FREQUENCY
   - Current: 2-minute epochs with 12 slots
   - Solution: Optimize epoch/slot ratio

3. TRANSACTION BATCHING THRESHOLDS
   - Current: Leaders may wait for "enough" transactions
   - Solution: Lower transaction thresholds

4. CONSENSUS OVERHEAD
   - Current: Quantum annealing takes 2-3ms per selection
   - Solution: Reduce quantum parameters for speed

5. NETWORK DELAYS
   - Current: 0.5s sleep intervals in polling
   - Solution: Faster polling and timeouts
