# Quantum Annealing Proof of Stake Blockchain in Python

This is an advanced implementation of a Proof of Stake blockchain that uses **Quantum Annealing** principles for consensus mechanism. The project demonstrates how quantum-inspired optimization can improve fairness, security, and decentralization in blockchain networks.

## Features

- Python 3.11
- **Quantum Annealing-based Proof of Stake** consensus algorithm
- Energy minimization approach for validator selection
- Multi-component energy function (stake, randomness, fairness)
- Dynamic parameter adjustment based on network conditions
- P2P communication
- Node API with FastAPI, with separation of concern
- Flexible: use docker or native
- Unit tests + CI/CD through Github Actions
- Logging - Datadog integration

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a research and demonstration project. Don't use in production. üòÖ

## Quantum Annealing Consensus

The quantum annealing consensus mechanism improves upon traditional PoS by:

- **Energy Minimization**: Validators selected based on multi-factor energy function
- **Fairness Component**: Prevents monopolization by large stake holders
- **Quantum-Inspired Randomness**: Adds unpredictability while maintaining security
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Parameters adjust automatically to network conditions

See [QUANTUM_ANNEALING_CONSENSUS.md](QUANTUM_ANNEALING_CONSENSUS.md) for detailed technical documentation.


## Running the blockchain nodes
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This command will start 3 nodes, running on ports 8010, 8011, and 8012. 

If you want to run the nodes on different ports, change the `DOCKER_NODE_PORTS` variable for each node container. Make sure the order of the ports is always the same between different containers, the socket connector logic assumes it is. 

### Native
If you don't want to use Docker, you can alternatively run the nodes straight from your terminal. First, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r blockchain/requirements/dev.txt
```

Now open up three terminal tabs, and run the following:

```sh
# Terminal 1
python run_node.py --ip=localhost --node_port=8010 --api_port=8050 --key_file=./keys/genesis_private_key.pem

# Terminal 2
python run_node.py --ip=localhost --node_port=8011 --api_port=8051 --key_file=./keys/staker_private_key.pem

# Terminal 3
python run_node.py --ip=localhost --node_port=8012 --api_port=8052
```

If you want to use different ports, make sure you provide a value for this variable in your terminal: `FIRST_NODE_PORT`. It defaults to `8010`, so therefore you won't need to specify it if you follow the example above.

## Adding transactions

To actually see the blockchain in action, you need to add some transactions. 

Run the following command:

```sh
python sample_transactions.py
```

This will add 7 transactions, with the current transaction pool set to 2 transactions per block, it will thus create 3 blocks and leave 1 transaction in the transaction pool. Visit `http://localhost:11000/api/v1/blockchain/` to view the blockchain!

## Docs

Visit the auto generated docs at the APIs of each that you run. Example: `http://localhost:11000/api/v1/docs/`

## Consensus algorithm

The Quantum Annealing PoS implementation uses an energy minimization approach inspired by quantum annealing to select validators. Unlike traditional PoS systems that use simple randomized selection based on stake weight, this implementation:

1. **Multi-Component Energy Function**: Combines stake weight (40%), randomness factor (30%), and fairness component (30%)
2. **Simulated Annealing Process**: Uses temperature scheduling to balance exploration vs exploitation
3. **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Automatically tunes annealing parameters based on network size and stake distribution
4. **Fairness Mechanisms**: Prevents complete monopolization by large stakers while maintaining incentives

The energy function for validator selection is:
```
E(validator) = w‚ÇÅ √ó E_stake + w‚ÇÇ √ó E_randomness + w‚ÇÉ √ó E_fairness
```

This approach provides better decentralization properties while maintaining the security guarantees of Proof of Stake consensus.

## Quantum Features Demo

To see the quantum annealing consensus in action:

```sh
# Start the blockchain nodes
docker compose up --build

# In another terminal, run the quantum demo
python blockchain/quantum_demo.py

# Compare with traditional PoS
python blockchain/compare_pos_mechanisms.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:11000/api/v1/blockchain/quantum-metrics/` to see real-time quantum annealing metrics. 

## Logging

Basic JSON logging has been implemented for the nodes, as well as the API. You'll see the output in the logs when you run docker compose up.

### Datadog integration

In production you'd ideally want something like datadog, to capture your logs. Since our log output is already in JSON format, datadog integration becomes easy. You can test out the log connection locally through docker compose, uncommenting lines 61-72. Then copy the `.env.example`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Now update the `DD_API_KEY` variable, with your API key. 

If you'd run this in production, e.g. AWS ECS, you would do something very similar. Just run the datadog agent as a sidecar and use the same variables as in the `.env.example`, but put them in the task definition. Since the nodes log to `stdout`, the agent will pick it up. Make sure you add the appropriate docker labels to your node container so it gets picked up (`DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CONTAINER_COLLECT_ALL` is set to `False`),

## Extra

Make sure the containers are running. Running this against node_one will update all nodes since docker makes use of a volume for the project root. 

Tests:

```sh
docker compose exec node_one pytest .
```

Lint:

```sh
docker compose exec node_one flake8 .
docker compose exec node_one black .
docker compose exec node_one isort --skip=env .
docker compose exec node_one bandit --configfile .bandit -r -ll .
```

Alternatively, if you run this natively. Just remove the `docker compose exec node_one` part before every command, make sure you are in the `blockchain` dir, and you are good to go.
