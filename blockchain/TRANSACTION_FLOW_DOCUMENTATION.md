# Transaction Flow: From Creation to Blockchain Inclusion

## Complete Transaction Lifecycle

This document describes the end-to-end flow of a transaction in the blockchain network, from creation to final inclusion in all nodes' blockchains.

## Phase 1: Transaction Creation and Signing

### Step 1: Transaction Initiation
```python
# User creates a transaction
sender_wallet = Wallet()
receiver_wallet = Wallet()

# Create and sign transaction
transaction = sender_wallet.create_transaction(
    receiver_wallet.public_key_string(), 
    amount=100.0, 
    type="TRANSFER"
)
```

**What happens internally:**
1. Transaction object created with sender, receiver, amount, and type
2. Unique transaction ID generated (`uuid.uuid1().hex`)
3. Timestamp added (`time.time()`)
4. Transaction payload prepared (all fields except signature)
5. Sender's private key signs the transaction payload
6. Signature attached to transaction

### Step 2: Transaction Validation (Client-side)
```python
# Verify transaction signature before sending
data = transaction.payload()
signature_valid = Wallet.signature_valid(
    data, 
    transaction.signature, 
    transaction.sender_public_key
)
```

## Phase 2: Transaction Submission to Network

### Step 3: Transaction Broadcasting
```python
# Submit transaction to network (via API or P2P)
node.submit_transaction(transaction)
```

**Network propagation:**
1. Transaction sent to one or more network nodes
2. Receiving nodes validate transaction signature
3. Valid transactions added to mempool/transaction pool
4. Transactions gossipped to peer nodes
5. Eventually reaches all network participants

### Step 4: Transaction Pool Management
```python
# Each node maintains a transaction pool
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transaction_pool = []
        self.blockchain = Blockchain()
    
    def submit_transaction(self, transaction):
        # Validate signature
        if self.validate_transaction_signature(transaction):
            self.transaction_pool.append(transaction)
            self.broadcast_to_peers(transaction)
```

## Phase 3: Leader Selection and Slot Assignment

### Step 5: Leader Selection
```python
# Quantum consensus selects next block proposer
current_leader = blockchain.next_block_proposer()

# Leader schedule determines current slot leader
slot_leader = blockchain.leader_schedule.get_current_leader()
```

**Leader selection process:**
1. **Quantum Consensus**: Uses quantum annealing to select representative node
2. **Leader Schedule**: Deterministic rotation based on stake and performance
3. **Slot Timing**: Each leader gets a specific time slot (e.g., 30 seconds)
4. **Authority**: Selected leader has authority to propose blocks for their slot

### Step 6: Gulf Stream Forwarding (Future Enhancement)
```python
# Transactions forwarded to upcoming leaders
upcoming_leaders = blockchain.get_upcoming_leaders(count=5)
for leader in upcoming_leaders:
    forward_transaction_to_leader(transaction, leader)
```

## Phase 4: PoH Sequencing and Block Creation

### Step 7: PoH Sequencing by Leader
```python
def create_block(self, transactions_from_pool, proposer_wallet):
    # Reset PoH sequencer for this slot
    last_block_hash = BlockchainUtils.hash(self.blocks[-1].payload()).hex()
    self.poh_sequencer.reset(last_block_hash)
    
    # Get valid transactions
    covered_transactions = self.get_covered_transaction_set(transactions_from_pool)
    
    # PoH Sequencing: Insert transactions into PoH stream
    for transaction in covered_transactions:
        # Add time ticks
        self.poh_sequencer.tick()
        
        # Ingest transaction into PoH stream
        self.poh_sequencer.ingest_transaction(transaction)
    
    # Complete the slot with final ticks
    for _ in range(3):
        self.poh_sequencer.tick()
```

**PoH Sequencing Process:**
1. **Continuous Hashing**: Leader runs continuous SHA256 hash chain
2. **Transaction Ingestion**: Each transaction mixed into current PoH hash
3. **Cryptographic Ordering**: Transaction gets unique position in hash chain
4. **Verifiable Timeline**: Creates tamper-proof record of transaction order

### Step 8: Transaction Validation and Execution
```python
# Validate transactions
def get_covered_transaction_set(self, transactions):
    covered_transactions = []
    for transaction in transactions:
        # 1. Verify signature
        if Wallet.signature_valid(transaction.payload(), transaction.signature, transaction.sender_public_key):
            # 2. Check balance coverage
            if self.transaction_covered(transaction):
                covered_transactions.append(transaction)
    return covered_transactions

# Execute transactions in PoH order
ordered_transactions = [entry.transaction for entry in poh_sequence if entry.transaction]
self.execute_transactions(ordered_transactions)
```

### Step 9: Block Creation
```python
# Create block with PoH sequence
new_block = proposer_wallet.create_block(
    ordered_transactions,
    last_block_hash,
    len(self.blocks)
)

# Attach PoH sequence for verification
new_block.poh_sequence = [entry.to_dict() for entry in poh_sequence]

# Add to local blockchain
self.blocks.append(new_block)
```

## Phase 5: Turbine Block Propagation

### Step 10: Block Shredding
```python
def broadcast_block_with_turbine(self, block, leader_id):
    # Shred the block into packets
    shreds = self.turbine_protocol.shredder.shred_block(block)
    
    # Get propagation tree children
    children = self.turbine_protocol.propagation_tree.get_children(leader_id)
    
    # Distribute shreds among children
    transmission_tasks = []
    shreds_per_child = len(shreds) // len(children)
    
    for child_id in children:
        child_shreds = shreds[start:start + shreds_per_child]
        transmission_tasks.append({
            'target_node': child_id,
            'shreds': child_shreds,
            'action': 'send_shreds'
        })
```

**Shredding Process:**
1. **Block Serialization**: Convert block to bytes
2. **Data Shredding**: Split into fixed-size packets (1024 bytes)
3. **Erasure Coding**: Generate recovery shreds for fault tolerance
4. **Indexing**: Each shred tagged with position and total count

### Step 11: Network Propagation Tree
```python
# Stake-weighted propagation tree
class TurbinePropagationTree:
    def _rebuild_tree(self):
        # Sort validators by stake weight
        sorted_nodes = sorted(self.nodes.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['stake_weight'], reverse=True)
        
        # Assign children based on fanout
        for i, (parent_id, _) in enumerate(sorted_nodes):
            start_child = i * self.fanout + 1
            end_child = min(start_child + self.fanout, len(sorted_nodes))
            
            for j in range(start_child, end_child):
                child_id = sorted_nodes[j][0]
                self.tree_structure[parent_id].append(child_id)
```

### Step 12: Shred Transmission and Forwarding
```python
def receive_shred(self, shred, receiving_node_id):
    # Store received shred
    self.received_shreds[shred.block_hash].append(shred)
    
    # Try to reconstruct block
    reconstructed = self.shredder.reconstruct_block(self.received_shreds[shred.block_hash])
    
    # Forward to children immediately (don't wait for full block)
    children = self.propagation_tree.get_children(receiving_node_id)
    forwarding_tasks = []
    for child_id in children:
        forwarding_tasks.append({
            'target_node': child_id,
            'shreds': [shred],
            'action': 'forward_shred'
        })
    
    return forwarding_tasks
```

## Phase 6: Block Reconstruction and Verification

### Step 13: Block Reconstruction
```python
def reconstruct_block(self, shreds):
    # Separate data and recovery shreds
    data_shreds = [s for s in shreds if s.is_data_shred]
    recovery_shreds = [s for s in shreds if not s.is_data_shred]
    
    # Check if enough shreds received
    if len(data_shreds) >= expected_data_shreds:
        # Reconstruct from data shreds
        return self._reconstruct_from_data_shreds(data_shreds)
    elif len(shreds) >= expected_data_shreds:
        # Use erasure coding to recover missing shreds
        return self._reconstruct_with_erasure_coding(data_shreds, recovery_shreds)
```

### Step 14: PoH Verification
```python
def verify_poh_sequence(self, block):
    """Fast cryptographic verification of transaction order"""
    poh_entries = block.poh_sequence
    
    # Verify hash chain integrity
    for i in range(1, len(poh_entries)):
        current_entry = poh_entries[i]
        previous_hash = poh_entries[i-1]['hash']
        
        # Verify each hash links to previous (much faster than re-execution)
        if current_entry.get('transaction'):
            # Verify: current_hash = sha256(previous_hash + transaction_data)
            pass
        else:
            # Verify: current_hash = sha256(previous_hash)
            pass
    
    return True
```

### Step 15: Block Validation
```python
def block_valid(self, block):
    """Complete block validation with PoH"""
    # 1. Basic structure validation
    if not self.block_count_valid(block):
        return False
    
    # 2. Hash chain validation
    if not self.last_block_hash_valid(block):
        return False
    
    # 3. Block proposer authority validation
    if not self.block_proposer_valid(block):
        return False
    
    # 4. PoH sequence verification (fast)
    if not self.verify_poh_sequence(block):
        return False
    
    # 5. Transaction validity (can be parallel due to PoH ordering)
    if not self.transactions_valid(block.transactions):
        return False
    
    return True
```

## Phase 7: Block Addition to Blockchain

### Step 16: State Execution
```python
def add_block(self, block):
    """Add validated block to blockchain"""
    # Execute transactions to update state
    self.execute_transactions(block.transactions)
    
    # Add block to chain
    self.blocks.append(block)
    
    # Update account balances
    for transaction in block.transactions:
        self.execute_transaction(transaction)
```

### Step 17: Network Consensus
```python
# Each validator independently:
# 1. Receives shreds via Turbine
# 2. Reconstructs the block
# 3. Verifies PoH sequence
# 4. Validates block structure
# 5. Adds block to local blockchain

# Network reaches consensus when majority of validators accept the block
```
