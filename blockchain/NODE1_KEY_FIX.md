# Node1 Key Generation Fix

## Problem
The blockchain node was failing to start with the error:
```
Failed to load private key from string: Could not deserialize key data... unsupported key type
```

## Root Cause
The blockchain node was trying to load `keys/node1_private_key.pem`, but our ECDSA key generation script only created keys for:
- `genesis` 
- `node2` through `node100`

The `node1` key was missing from our key generation.

## Solution
Generated the missing ECDSA P-256 key pair for `node1`:

```bash
python generate_node1_key.py
```

## Verification
âœ… Created `keys/node1_private_key.pem` (241 bytes)
âœ… Created `keys/node1_public_key.pem` (178 bytes)  
âœ… Key format verified as ECDSA P-256 PEM
âœ… Signing test passed (11.7ms including key loading)
âœ… Verification test passed
âœ… Wrong message correctly rejected

## Key Details
- **Algorithm**: ECDSA P-256 (secp256r1)
- **Format**: PEM encoding
- **Security**: 128-bit security level
- **Performance**: ~0.8ms signing (after key loading)

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **RESOLVED** - The blockchain node should now start successfully with the ECDSA P-256 keys.
