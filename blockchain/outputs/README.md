# Outputs Directory Organization

This directory contains organized outputs from blockchain analysis scripts and monitoring tools.

## Directory Structure

```
outputs/
├── reports/          # Performance reports and analysis results
│   ├── demo_reports/ # Demo and sample reports
│   ├── performance_report_*.txt      # Performance analysis reports
│   ├── performance_metrics_*.csv     # CSV data for detailed analysis
│   ├── pos_comparison_*.txt          # PoS mechanism comparison reports
│   └── quantum_consensus_report_*.txt # Quantum consensus analysis
└── logs/             # System and monitoring logs
    └── monitoring_logs/ # Real-time monitoring data
```

## File Types

### Reports (`/reports/`)
- **Performance Reports** (`performance_report_*.txt`): Generated by `simple_performance.py` and `performance_analyzer.py`
- **CSV Metrics** (`performance_metrics_*.csv`): Detailed metrics data with transaction, consensus, and block data
- **PoS Comparison** (`pos_comparison_*.txt`): Comparison between traditional PoS and quantum annealing consensus
- **Demo Reports** (`demo_reports/`): Sample reports from demonstration runs

### Logs (`/logs/`)
- **Monitoring Logs** (`monitoring_logs/`): Real-time monitoring data from performance analyzers
- **System Logs**: Various system-level logs from blockchain operations

## Analysis Scripts Output

| Script | Output Location | File Pattern |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| `simple_performance.py` | `/outputs/reports/` | `performance_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` |
| `performance_analyzer.py` | `/outputs/reports/` | `performance_metrics_*_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` |
| `compare_pos_mechanisms.py` | `/outputs/reports/` | `pos_comparison_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` |

## Usage

All analysis scripts automatically create the appropriate directory structure and save their outputs to the organized locations. No manual configuration is required.

Example:
```bash
# Run performance analysis
cd blockchain/analysis
python3 simple_performance.py --nodes 5

# Output automatically saved to:
# outputs/reports/performance_report_20250719_123456.txt
```

## File Naming Convention

Files use timestamp-based naming for easy chronological organization:
- Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Example: `20250719_232115` = July 19, 2025 at 23:21:15

This ensures all outputs are uniquely named and sorted by creation time.
