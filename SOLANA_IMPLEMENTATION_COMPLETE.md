## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### SealevelExecutor Core Components:

1. **TransactionDependency**
   - Analyzes read/write access patterns
   - Detects account-level conflicts
   - Enables safe parallel execution

2. **ParallelExecutionBatch**
   - Groups non-conflicting transactions
   - Executes transactions concurrently
   - Provides atomic state updates

3. **AccountModel**
   - Thread-safe account operations
   - Automatic account creation
   - Balance validation and transfers

### Integration Points:

1. **Blockchain.create_block()** - Enhanced with parallel execution
2. **Node.propose_block()** - Updated logging for Solana features
3. **Block metadata** - Attached parallel execution results and state root
